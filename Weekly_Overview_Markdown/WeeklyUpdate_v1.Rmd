# PANDA Weekly Report and Data Summary

## Overview of Recruitment

```{r, warning = F}
# First, let's make a table to provide a regular update on recruitment. 
# Work towards doing this programmatically, so that the numbers get pulled from redcap each time the markdown is generated, as opposed to you having to manually update them

Completed <- 15 # number of subjects that have completed the protocol
Part1_Only <- 4 # number of subjects that have completed part 1 only
Total_Enrolled <- Completed + Part1_Only # number of subjects enrolled in the study (consented)
Scheduled_NotRun <- 0 # number of subjects that have been scheduled but not yet run
Need_to_Screen <- 49 # subjects that need to be screened
Total_Screened <- 36 # number of subjects that have been screened
Screen2Run_Conversion <- ((Part1_Only+Completed) / Total_Screened)*100 # Screen to Completion Conversion rate

(recruitment_table <- data.frame(Completed, Part1_Only, Total_Enrolled, Scheduled_NotRun, Need_to_Screen, Total_Screened, Screen2Run_Conversion) %>% pivot_longer(Completed:Screen2Run_Conversion, names_to = "Metric", values_to = "Value"))

```

## Demographic and Clinical Characterization of Part 1 Completers

```{r, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}

# Overall Sample First

demo<-bsrc::bsrc.getform(protocol = panda_protocol,online = TRUE,formname = "demographic_information")

#get rid of character ids
demo$record_id <- as.numeric(demo$record_id)
demo <- demo %>% filter(!is.na(record_id))

Mean_Age <- mean(demo$demo_age) #mean age of the sample
SD_Age <- sd(demo$demo_age) #standard deviation of age in the sample
N_Female <- table(demo$demo_gender)[2]
N_Asian <- sum(demo$demo_race___1, na.rm = T)
N_AmIndianNative <- sum(demo$demo_race___2, na.rm = T)
N_Black <- sum(demo$demo_race___3, na.rm = T)

#percentages can be helpful for some of these, so let's add a column for those
(demographic_table <- demographic_table %>% mutate(Percent = if_else(grepl('^N_', demographic_table$Demographic), ((demographic_table$Value / Total_Enrolled) * 100), NA_real_)))

#for income, let's convert it to a factor, specify levels, and plot: 
demo$demo_income <- as.factor(demo$demo_income)
levels(demo$demo_income) <- c("<25k", "25-35k", "35-50k", "50-75k", "75-100k", "100-150k", ">150k", "No Answer")

ggplot(demo, aes(x = demo_income)) + geom_histogram(stat = "count") + theme_cowplot()

#same deal for education
demo$demo_education <- as.factor(demo$demo_education)
levels(demo$demo_education) <- c("Some HS", "HS/GED", "Some College", "Associates", "BA/BS", "Postgrad", "Masters", "Phd/JD/MD")

ggplot(demo, aes(x = demo_education)) + geom_histogram(stat = "count") + theme_cowplot()

N_level<-bsrc::bsrc.getform(protocol = panda_protocol,online = TRUE,formname = "record_registration")

# High N


#Low N
