Parameters 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All parameters that need to be modified on a subject-by-subject basis are in the
file 'modifyme.m'. They are explained there. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the experiment 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are now three parts to the experiment: before the scanner; during the
scanner; and after the scanner. 

To run any of the parts, first edit the 'modifyme.m' file to enter the
subject-specific data. Then type 

	runexperiment

at the matlab command line and hit enter. You will then be asked which part of
the experiment you want to run. 

NOTE: you will need to supply the previous .mat files (the programme will ask
you for them) when you run parts two (inside the scanner) and three (after the
scanner). I.e. 

	- when running part 1, you will not need to supply a .mat file. 
	- when running part 2, you will not need to supply the .mat file saved at the
	  end of part 1. 
	- when running part 3, you will not need to supply the .mat file saved at the
	  end of part 2. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MAIN FILES are the following: 

	modifyme.m     
		- is the only file that should need modifying once the experiment is run

	runexperiment.m       
		- is the master file. All other scripts are called by this file.  This is the
		  file that should be run in the matlab window to start the experiment. 

EXITING 

	Once the experiment is running, you have to keep clicking the mouse while
	keeping the 'escape' button down in order to exit the experiment. As soon as
	the 'checkabort' routine is run (which happens frequently throughout the
	experiment), psychtoolbox will exit graciously without crashing matlab. 

The files that do all the work are: 

	expparams.m
		- contains all the experimental parameters that should not be altered
		  between subjects, like trial numbers, outcome probability etc. 

	preps.m        
		- is the file that sets up the stimulus presentation sequences, ensuring that
		  all stimuli, actions and presentations are counterbalanced etc. 

	setup.m        
		- sets up the display variables, starts psychtoolbox and its sound
		  subcomponent, and loads all the images that'll be needed. 

	pittraining.m  
		- is the instrumental training 

	pit.m          
		- is the PIT part of the task 

	pavlov.m       
		- is the pavlovian training

	compare.m      
		- runs the Pavlovian query / test trials interleaved with the Pavlovian
		  training

	compareadd.m      
		- runs the additional Pavlovian query / test trials at the end of the
		  Pavlovian blocks outside the scanner 

	debrief.m 
		- asks a few questions to test explicit knowledge. 

Any file with 'instr' in it is some sort of instruction. 
	- pitinstr_approach: instructions for the approach   instrumental training block 
	- pitinstr_avoid:    instructions for the withdrawal instrumental training block 
	- pitinstr_start:    tells subject that the PIT block is about to start
	- pavinstr: 			instructions for the Pavlovian training block 
	- pavinstr_short:    warns subjects of upcoming brief Pavlovian refresher training 
	                     in second block 
	- pavinstr_scan:     initial instructions for refrescher Pavlovian training
	                     inside the scanner
	- instr_extraquery:  instructions for the extra query trials
	- instr_insidescannerend:  end of scan session instructions

Finally, there are a couple of 'helper' files for stuff I use a lot again and
again: 

	centermouseclick.m 
		- displays the organge square to re-centre the mouse after each trial

	checkabort.m   
		- To abort, hold down the escape key and click with the mouse a couple of
		  times. This file aborts the experiment if you do that. 

	displaytext.m, displaycentraltext.m  and displaylargetext.m
		- are files that display text, either just a single line or a series of
		  lines, nicely centred. displaylargetext.m displays larger text (the size
		  of which is set by the variable 'txtlarge'. 

	givebreak.m    
		- inserts a 2 minute break after the first block

	mygetclicks.m  
		- waits for a mouse click

Variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I guess it might be helpful to just mention a few of the variable names and
their meaning. The ones that need altering are in the 'modifyme' script, and are
commented there. 

approach is 1 if the current block is an approach block, 0 otherwise

shroom
	- 1: use mushrooms as instrumental stimuli
	- 0: use shells as instrumental stimuli instead 

nt   - instrumental trial number 
np   - pavlovian trial number 
npit - PIT trial number 
nq,nqa - query and add-on query trial numbers 

ch, cht
	- variables indicating the subjects' number of button presses in the PIT (ch)
	  and instrumental (cht) trials respectively. 

chq
	- indicates which of the two stimuli the subject chose during each of the
	  Pavlovian query trials 

th
	- is the threshold between what is defined as a 'go' and a 'nogo' response
	  for the purpose or determining feedbacks. This corresponds to whether the
	  blue dot ends up inside the square or not. 

cr, crt, crm 
	- whether choice in PIT (cr) or instrumental block (crt) was correct. A
	  correct go approach trial means that the subject pressed the bar more than
	  'th' times. 'crm' tells us whether subject chose the better Pavlovian
	  stimulus during the Pavlovian query trials. 

presstimes, presstimest
	- are the times of the button presses (in PIT and instrumental training
	  blocks, respectively) relative to the onset of the mushroom stimulus. 

pitreact and treact
	- reaction times in PIT trials (pitreact) and instrumental trials (treact)
	  respectively (the first entry of presstimes and presstimest, respectively).

Instrumental block

	ainst    correct response (go or nogo) for each trial
	mprest	which mushroom to present in each trial
	lrt		whether to present mushroon on right or left of centre
	crtfb		whether to give accurate or erroneous feedback 
	crt		whether correct action chosen 
	r			whether a reward or punishment was given 

PIT block	
	
	ains    	correct response (go or nogo) for each trial
	mpres		which mushroom to present in each trial
	mpresp	which Pavlovian stimulus to tile the background with
	lr			whether to present mushroon on right or left of centre
	cr			whether correct action made 

Pavlovian block 
	
	pavpres	which Pavlovian stimulus to present during trainig
	posp		whether to present the Pavlovian stimulus on left or right

	cppres	which two Pavlovian stimuli to present on comparison (query) trials 
	crm		whether the correct (better) Pavlovian stimulus was chosen on comparison trials
	cppresadd	which two Pavlovian stimuli to present during the add-on comparison (query) trials 
	crma		   whether the correct (better) Pavlovian stimulus was chosen on add-on comparison trials
